# ipylang

## Installation

```sh
pip install ipylang
```

## Development installation

Create a virtual environment and and install ipylang in *editable* mode with the
optional development dependencies:

```sh
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Open `example.ipynb` in JupyterLab, VS Code, or your favorite editor
to start developing. Changes made in `src/ipylang/static/` will be reflected
in the notebook.
