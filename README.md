# ipylangchat ðŸ¤–ðŸ’¬

A minimal Chat UI Jupyter Widget for language models. Built with [anywidget](https://anywidget.dev) ðŸ’ª. 

Lets you talk to a [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) runnable or agent, such as a [conversational RAG](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/tutorials/rag/), directly in a Jupyter environment (Notebook, Lab, Google Colab, VSCode). No need to serve a web application.

See the [RAG example](./example.ipynb) notebook.

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> This is still a very basic implementation that demonstrates the power of the anywidget framework to bring custom UIs into Jupyter.

Right now, the widget accepts a [chain](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/expression_language/interface/) using a [prompt template](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/concepts/#prompt-templates) that takes in human input and keeps track of chat history. See the langchain [docs](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/how_to/qa_chat_history_how_to/) and our [example](./example.ipynb) of a conversational RAG on the anywidget documentation.

```python
import ipylangchat

ipylangchat.ChatUIWidget(chain)
```

## Installation

```sh
pip install ipylangchat
```

## Development installation

Create a virtual environment and and install ipylangchat in *editable* mode with the
optional development dependencies:

```sh
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Open `example.ipynb` in JupyterLab, VS Code, or your favorite editor
to start developing. Changes made in `src/ipylangchat/static/` will be reflected
in the notebook.
